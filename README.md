The Indian Premier League (IPL) has become a cricket sensation, captivating audiences worldwide since its inception in 2008. This project addresses the rising popularity of fantasy cricket, aiming to help enthusiasts make informed decisions in team selection. Leveraging data mining techniques, the project introduces two innovative methods:
Performance-Based Scoring Metric Model: Using linear regression, a custom dataset was curated with ball-by-ball information, considering various player metrics. The model, trained on the past five years' data, yielded an 80% accuracy in predicting player performances. The inclusion of a "time value" feature, dynamic weights, and careful scaling contributed to the model's success.
In-Game Position-Based Optimal Cluster Prediction Using K-means Clustering: This method focused on clustering players based on their positions (batsmen, bowlers) and introducing a weighted score for a nuanced evaluation. The K-means clustering model, with three clusters for each batting position and four for bowlers, resulted in errors ranging from 27% to 30%.
The evaluation against real-time cricket platforms ensured the methodology's practical applicability. The project provides fantasy cricket enthusiasts with a data-driven approach to team selection, offering transparency and trust in the selection process. While achieving promising results, there's room for further optimization in model weights and exploration of different training periods for enhanced accuracy.

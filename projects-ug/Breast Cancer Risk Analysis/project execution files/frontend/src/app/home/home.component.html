    <h3>What is Breast Cancer</h3>
    <p>
      Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of
      control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast
      cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breast cancer can begin in different parts of the breast. A breast is made
      up of three main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissue. The lobules
      are the glands that produce milk. The ducts are tubes that carry milk to
      the nipple. The connective tissue (which consists of fibrous and fatty
      tissue) surrounds and holds everything together. Most breast cancers begin
      in the ducts or lobules. Breast cancer can spread outside the breast
      through blood vessels and lymph vessels. When breast cancer spreads to
      other parts of the body, it is said to have metastasized.
